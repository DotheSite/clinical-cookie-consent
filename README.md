# Clinical Cookie Consent

A lightweight WordPress cookie-consent plugin built for real client sites.

This plugin is intentionally minimal, style-controlled, and supports CSS variables so it can inherit existing theme design systems without duplication.

## Features
- Reject All / Required Only / Accept All logic
- WP Dashboard Menu Settings controls for easy styling and core functionality
- Main CSS variable support for colors (e.g. `var(--brand-accent)`) or color code
- Clean, fixed-position banner (bottom)
- Client-friendly defaults
- No ads, no tracking, no bloat
- X does not imply consent—the banner reappears until a choice is made
- Clean uninstall (removes stored options)


## Status
